# Designing Data Intensive Applications

I just write down some notes here from reading the book.

## Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Applications

Definition of the terms that we want to have for good data intensive applications:

Reliable: works as expected even in special situations e.g. faults in other systems
Scalable: can easily be adapted to work for higher load/more data. Important what kind of load
Maintainability: easy to operate, easy to understand for people maintaining it and easy to extend

## Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages
